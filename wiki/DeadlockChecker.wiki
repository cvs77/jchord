=== Toy Example ===

See the example in directory `chord/examples/deadlock_test/` of the Chord 2.0 distribution.  The `README` file in that directory explains how to run the deadlock checker on the example.  The deadlock checker upon successful completion should produce file [http://chord.stanford.edu/examples/deadlock_test/deadlocks.html deadlocks.html].

=== Case Studies ===

Details of the experimental results reported in [http://berkeley.intel-research.net/mnaik/pubs/icse09/paper.pdf our ICSE'09 paper] are available [http://berkeley.intel-research.net/mnaik/pubs/icse09/results.html here].

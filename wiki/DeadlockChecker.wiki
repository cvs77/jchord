#summary Running Deadlock Checker and Experimental Results
#labels Featured

=== Getting Started ===

Run the deadlock checker on the example Java program in directory `main/examples/deadlock_test/` of the Chord 2.0 distribution by following the instructions in the `README` file in that directory.  Upon successful completion, the checker should produce file [http://chord.stanford.edu/examples/deadlock_test/deadlocks.html deadlocks.html].

=== Configuration Options ===

Read the section titled ``Static Deadlock Analysis" in the chapter on [http://chord.stanford.edu/user_guide/predefined.html Predefined Analyses] in Chord's user guide for how to configure aspects of the deadlock checker that affect its performance, precision, and soundness.

=== Case Studies ===

Details of the experimental results reported in [http://berkeley.intel-research.net/mnaik/research/icse09.pdf our ICSE'09 paper] are available [http://berkeley.intel-research.net/mnaik/research/icse09_results.html here].

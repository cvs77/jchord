#summary Running Datarace Checker and Experimental Results
#labels Featured

=== Getting Started ===

Run the datarace checker on the example Java program in directory `main/examples/datarace_test/` of the Chord 2.1 distribution by following the instructions in the `README` file in that directory.  Upon successful completion, the checker should produce files
[http://pag.cc.gatech.edu/chord/examples/datarace_test/dataraces_by_fld.html dataraces_by_fld.html] and [http://pag.cc.gatech.edu/chord/examples/datarace_test/dataraces_by_obj.html dataraces_by_obj.html].

=== Configuration Options ===

Read the section titled ``Static Datarace Analysis" in the chapter on [http://pag.cc.gatech.edu/chord/user_guide/predefined.html Predefined Analyses] in Chord's user guide for how to configure aspects of the datarace checker that affect its performance, precision, and soundness.

=== Case Studies ===

Details of the experimental results reported in [http://pag.cc.gatech.edu/pubs/pldi06.pdf our PLDI'06 paper] are available [http://pag.cc.gatech.edu/pubs/pldi06_results.html here].

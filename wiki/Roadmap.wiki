#summary Roadmap for Chord

== Chord 2.0 ==

  * Test suite
  * Features
    * allow domains and relations to be loaded from disk instead of re-running analyses every time to construct them afresh (requires joeq.`*` to be serializable)
    * make Chord scope construction deterministic
  * Bug fixes
    * bddbddb constructs a wrong stratification for certain Datalog programs with mutually recursive rules
  * Documentation
    * How to write a program analysis in Chord (domains, relations, static analysis in Datalog, static analysis in Java, dynamic analysis)
    * How to fix performance problems in analyses written in Datalog and solved using bddbddb
    * Javadoc

== Chord 3.0 ==

  * Use a declarative language like Concurrent Collections to allow users to rapidly prototype new program analyses by combining existing analyses in complex ways.

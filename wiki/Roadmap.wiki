#summary Roadmap for Chord 2.0

TODO:
  * Features
    * make Chord scope construction deterministic
    * write more dynamic analyses akin to that for escape analysis, and also make dynamic versions of race and deadlock checkers
    * tune bddvarorders to make race and deadlock checkers faster
  * Documentation
    * How to write a program analysis in Chord (domains, relations, static analysis in Datalog, static analysis in Java, dynamic analysis)
    * How to fix performance problems in analyses written in Datalog and solved using bddbddb

DONE:
  * Test suite
    * allow domains and relations to be loaded from disk instead of re-running analyses every time to construct them afresh (requires joeq.`*` to be serializable) (ALLOWED ONLY RELATIONS TO BE LOADED FROM DISK; SERIALIZING JOEQ IS TOO COMPLICATED)
  * Bug fixes
    * bddbddb constructs a wrong stratification for certain Datalog programs with mutually recursive rules (FILED A BUG)
  * Documentation
    * Javadoc
